# ðŸš€ Space Missions Data Analysis (1957â€“2020)

This project explores a comprehensive dataset from [nextspaceflight.com](https://nextspaceflight.com) covering global space missions from 1957 to 2020. It includes detailed insights into mission success rates, costs, organisations, countries, launch trends, and more.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Highlights

- **Dataset**: 4,000+ space missions from 1957 to 2020  
- **Source**: NextSpaceFlight.com  
- **Tools Used**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, ISO3166  

## ðŸ§  Key Insights

- USA and Russia dominated launches throughout the Cold War era.
- A shift in dominance post-2000 with private players like SpaceX emerging.
- Most launches occurred in **March** and **October**, possibly due to weather and mission planning cycles.
- **Success rate** of missions significantly improved over time.
- **Mission cost** trends show a wide variation depending on the country and organisation.
- Pie charts, bar graphs, sunburst charts, and choropleth maps were used for visualization.

## ðŸ“Š Analyses Performed

- Number of launches by country and organisation
- Monthly and yearly launch patterns
- Success vs failure rates across time
- Cost of missions over time and by organisation
- Cold War space race: USSR vs USA
- Launch patterns by top 10 organisations
- Sunburst charts for hierarchical mission data
- Choropleth map showing global space activity
